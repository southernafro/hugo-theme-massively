If you are thinking of getting yourself a Labrador retriever there are so many things to consider before you even think of it. Firstly you need to be aware of the amount that you will have to spend on getting one, as well as the age you want to get. There are other costs involved, both financial, emotional and in terms of time and effort. So we need to look at those too.

The cost of a Labrador puppy is estimated to be roughly $800 to $1200. For an adult one, you’ll be looking at roughly $500 that is if you are willing to adopt one from a local shelter. There are many things to consider before taking on the responsibility of a Labrador dog. Price is just one of them and it should be the least of your worries.

The costs and the chances that a dog will bring to your life are some things you should sit and really think about. The following are some factors that may help you think and find out if you are fit to have a dog right now.

Dogs need space, both indoors and outside. Even small breeds need room to stretch their legs and run about, and Labradors as fairly large and lively dogs need quite a lot of space. So if you have a backyard that would be perfect.

Like children dogs also need time and space. It is always sad to hear from new puppy owners that are struggling to juggle the needs of a puppy with their need to work.

### Can You Afford A Dog?

Dogs can be quite expensive to run. You need to consider not only how much a Labrador will cost you to buy, but also how much it will cost you to keep. The regular vet visits and dog food may really take up a lot of money from your pocket

### Will A Lab Suit Your Lifestyle?

Buying a Labrador will change your life quite drastically. In fact, bringing any dog into your life will be a dramatic change. Hence you should consider if the dog will fit in well with your lifestyle.

### Will A Dog Fit In With Your Family?

It doesn’t matter how big or small your house is. It’s important that the dog fits right in with your family. You should consider allergies, moods and if they can have time for the dog because you may end up being the only one who cares about the dog.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Labrador Retrievers are amazing shaggy dogs. They are quite intelligent and very friendly to both adults and kids. If you are looking to buy one you will never be disappointed. It’s a good dog especially if you are looking to get something that will be part of the family.
