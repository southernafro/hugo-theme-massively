The fact that they run around so much and you can not keep tabs on them also means that they can easily get ticks, whether they are running in the grass or playing with other dogs. The eight-legged parasites, suck on your dog's blood and feed on them. Different types of ticks can affect your animals, including dog ticks.

They are usually found in wooded areas and tall grass. All the places your dog probably loves to take a walk through or play in. The eight-legged parasites are active throughout the year, which means that your dog can have a tick bite regardless of the season or time of the year.

## What do you do if your dog has a tick?

Just like other parasites, ticks look for a host, latch on, and fed on it for survival. You can prevent your dog from getting further ticks, by using pet-friendly sprays and shampoos that help keep ticks at bay.

Once you find that your dog has ticks, there is a high possibility that it will have more, even after you remove the one that you see. This is because you can not tell where the ticks came from or stop your dog from going there again. Like in a lot of cases, prevention is better than cure.

If you suspect that your dog already has ticks, the first thing that you want to do is to spot the ticks so that you can deal with them. When you realize that your pet has ticks, you can try to remove them.

However, resist the urge to plunk it out without care. You must do this very slowly, skillfully, and carefully. Otherwise, it is painful for the dog. Also when you do this, some of the embedded mouth bits of the tick can remain in the dog's skin, causing tissue irritation.

Make sure not to squeeze the tick or probe at its body. If you squeeze the tick it can expel blood back into the dog and cause infection. Other dangerous means of removing ticks, include suffocating it with petroleum jelly, trying to burn it off with a flame, or poking and probing it.

This will just irritate the parasite. Avoid doing this at all costs. The best way to remove ticks is to twist them off carefully. You can find the ideal tools for doing this, at pet stores.

Some ticks find their way into your dog's ear, and you may see your dog trying to get rid of it by scratching. Take a look in your dog's ear using a torch. Removing a tick from your dog is a delicate process and should only be done under the instruction of a medical professional.

Find out how your vet advises that you remove the ticks. If you will be removing it yourself, make sure to disinfect the area where it was on the dog's skin, place the tick in a sealable bag, and throw it away in the trash. 

Remember to also wash your hands and disinfect surfaces when you are done. You do not want to spread more parasites in a bid to get rid of one.

Ticks are not uncommon in dogs especially if your dog has been out in a wooded or grassy it may have got bitten by a tick and brought it back home. But is it something that should worry you or do you just leave it to be?

## How long does it take for a tick to embed?

There are various types of ticks, and as such, they take different amounts of time to embed. The amount of time it takes for a tick to embed in its host determines the species of the tick and also how long it takes for the host to respond. With all things being equal, it will take about three days for larvae to embed whilst it will take adults between seven and ten days.

## Should I take my dog to the vet after a tick bite?

Yes, this is important to do, so that you make sure that the dog is not infected with a disease that could potentially be dangerous for both you as the pet owner and your dog as well.
