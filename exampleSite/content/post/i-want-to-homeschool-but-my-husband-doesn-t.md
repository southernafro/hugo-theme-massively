Raising a child with a partner is not always a bed of agreement. You will come to crossroads, where you may not particularly agree with your partner's point of view when it comes to raising your child or children. If you're in the position where you are saying to yourself “I want to homeschool but my husband doesn’t”, we will look at ways to tackle this and still keep the peace in the house.

There are different approaches to take. However one of the more important things to keep in mind and find a way of communicating, is that homeschooling is not an inferior way of educating your children, neither is it a lesser alternative. It is a viable means with a vast array of advantages. Now let’s dive into tactical ways of getting through to your partner, shall we?

## What are the advantages of homeschooling?

Getting someone on the same page as you, who doesn’t think the same way that you do is no easy feat. Especially when it involves the future of your child or children. One of the best places to start is the initial understanding of what homeschooling is. You can not convince someone of something that you do not understand yourself.

### Familiar environment

Homeschooling has several advantages. One of those is that you get to teach your child in an environment that they are comfortable in. They will have more freedom to explore and discover who they are and what they are gifted in. You could use the argument that a child will usually be more inquisitive when they are in a space they are comfortable with, such as at home.

Think about all the times that you went visiting with your child for the first time. How did they behave? Was it the same behavior as when they are at home? You are not entirely sure of the character and behavior that your child exhibits when they are away at school. But when you homeschool them, you know exactly what it is and you can either encourage it or not.

Also, studies show that a good family environment is a great place for a child to learn, grow, and discover more about how they interact with the world.

### Focused teaching and learning

Another advantage is that your child gets more one on one time than if they are in a public school. In a regular class, your child may be one of 20 or 30 students, sometimes more, depending on the school that you choose. This doesn’t allow the teacher to focus a great deal on your child. Learning will be more general than focused on your child.

### Special needs

The other advantage of homeschooling your child is that you can zone in on your child's special needs. If your child has any special needs, be they physical or learning challenges, it is harder to pinpoint them and help your child effectively when they are one in a dozen or more kids.

### Pacing

Also, homeschooling will help you move at your own pace and the pace of the child. In a public school or a class with several other children, a teacher has to move at the set pace rather than that of an individual child. If a child is lagging, and they are a mere number, then they will probably always be lagging. But if you are teaching your child at home, you can pick up any challenges the child is facing and address them, or perhaps change the teaching style.

### You can tailor the teaching style to the child.

There are several teaching styles, and not all children respond to them in the same way. The great thing about homeschooling is that you can tailor the teaching style to suit your child and the way they respond. It's easier to change a teaching style that’s not working when you have one student, rather than when you have an entire class.

### You can teach hands-on experience for your child

A typical structured classroom set up is usually more focused on book theory. There is very little done in terms of learning through experiencing certain things. You can also be more involved with helping people in the community, teaching your child about the values of kindness, social responsibility, and the importance of being part of society. These are things that may be lacking in formal classrooms.

### Keeps your child calmer.

Homeschooling removes the anxiety that is associated with test-taking. This is usually how public schools are structured. Students learn to take tests. This can be disruptive for the child's development. Homeschooling does not involve test-taking and hence the child is more focused on learning and will usually develop a love for learning, rather than dread. There is a lot less stress in such a scenario.

### Instills a deep sense of fulfillment

With homeschooling, you can choose methods that allow your child to lead with their interests. This can foster a sense of achievement as they accomplish tasks that they have set out for themselves with your guidance.

### Vocational training

Homeschooling can help teenagers who already know what they want to do after school, by allowing them to train for their chosen vocation. It allows the students to seek out mentorship in their areas of interest, hence giving them a jumpstart on their careers.

### Gets your child out of harm's way

Homeschooling also offers your child a safe space to learn. Unless you do the bullying, your child will not have to face bullying from peers at school. Instead, they learn to be comfortable in their skin. According to Yale University studies, children who are bullied, are up to 9 times more likely to commit suicide.

## The last word

Whilst you will need to get all the necessary resources depending on the method that you have chosen, you can have the last word in, by pointing out that homeschooling is generally more affordable than public school.

Ultimately, it is more about getting what is best for your child and not being right. Helping your spouse see things your way may take some time, but think about the bigger picture and stick to your guns the way you know-how. We hope the ammunition we have given you helps you do so.
