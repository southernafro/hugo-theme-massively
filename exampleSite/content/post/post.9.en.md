Make sure that the nest is placed in a place with good temperature, room temperature usually works well. Try to make it secluded and comfortable enough for both mother and puppies.

Most dogs do not need human help to give birth. But as a pet owner, you must do your bit to ensure that it goes smoothly. Make sure that you have all the necessary supplies. Be on standby. Your role is to help if necessary, otherwise do not interfere unnecessarily. She is wired to do this on her own.

When the puppies are born, they are each encased in individual placental membranes. The mother will usually take this membrane off as soon as they are born, but if she does not, you must do it for her. This is because puppies can only survive for a few minutes in there before they suffocate. The mother will also usually be the one to clean up her puppies and also cut the umbilical cord. If this does not happen, you will need to do it as well.

When wiping down the puppies, use iodine so that you can prevent any infections that can be harmful and even fatal for the puppies. Make sure the cord is cut about 2 inches away from the puppy. Also, watch to see that all the placentas have been birthed and none is remaining in the mother. This can be very dangerous for the mother.

## How long does it take a dog to give birth?

A dog can take up to 12 hours to give birth. Labor for a dog is in three stages. The first being pre-whelping where you begin to see the signs of the onset of labor. This then progresses into the delivery of the puppies. After every thirty minutes or so, a puppy is born. At this stage, the mother will need to push about two or three times for the puppy to be born.

The mother will normally break the amniotic sac herself and simultaneously clean the puppies but in the event, this doesn't happen, you need to lend a hand. Once the puppies are born, you need to make sure that there is no remaining placenta in the mother's belly. The total amount of whelping time is usually between 6 and twelve hours.
