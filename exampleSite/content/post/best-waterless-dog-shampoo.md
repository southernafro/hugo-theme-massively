It works the same way as a leave-in conditioner. Simply spray on and brush your dog. It also works well as a detangler. However, you will need to be careful of allergic reactions if your dog is allergic.

### [Pet Head Dry Clean Spray Blueberry Muffin For Pets]()

This is another waterless spray shampoo that you can use on your dog. It is not a comprehensive shampoo, so you will still need to do the full bath, but it's great as a temporary measure. It does not contain any harmful ingredients. One of the disadvantages is that it is difficult to carry around with you, because of the shape of the bottle.

### Bodhi Dog Waterless Shampoo

This is a quick fix to cleaning your dog and letting them back in the house without running a bath for them. It’s a waterless shampoo that is targeted at cleaning and may also leave your dogs feeling softer and smelling good.

There aren’t any colorants nor are there any artificial ingredients that potentially cause a reaction and it is also pH balanced especially for pets.

### Lillian Ruff Waterless Dog Shampoo - No Rinse Quick Dry Shampoo Spray for Dogs and Cats

It is easy to use. Simply spray on and brush down. It does not need water. It’s a mixture of essential oils like coconut oil and lavender. It also comes in a spray bottle making it easy to use. The scent is neutral and lasts long. The downside is that this is not a heavy-duty shampoo, if your dog has gotten their fur very dirty, you may need to go the whole nine yards.

## Conclusion
