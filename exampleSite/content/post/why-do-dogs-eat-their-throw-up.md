I’ve always wondered why dogs eat their throw up. Before I rescued my Sally, I’d never had the honor or adventure of living with a dog or seeing their daily habits such as eating their throw up, so it was a thought that had never crossed my mind. 

But now that I’ve seen it, it got me wondering if it's normal and if it’s something I ought to be worried about. Are there any health implications that I need to worry about? In this article, we take a look at why dogs eat their throw up. We explore if this is safe behavior. Let’s take a look, shall we?

Expanded list-explanations why dogs eat their throw up

Just thinking about it makes you cringe. But your dogs’ senses know better than to eat with his or her eyes. Your dog has a great sense of smell. 

This means that your dog looks at his or her throw up, and smells it for what it is. If it has food in it, it will be eaten. Your dogs’ senses will pick out the food in the throw-up and eat that. This is why your dog will sometimes smell, throw up, and walk away.

When dogs try to wean their puppies off milk, it can be a hassle to get the new pups accustomed to solid foods. To help this process along, mums may regurgitate food and get the pups eating that. 

Slowly but surely the puppy gets used to eating solid food. Some say the reason that dogs go back to eat their vomit is that old habits die hard

### Is it safe for my dog to eat his throw up?

Long story cut short, yes. It is safe for your dog to eat his or her throw up. Whilst it may be an unsightly activity for you, it is natural. 

Eating their throw up is safe for your dog unless they have swallowed something that is toxic or dangerous and should not have been swallowed in the first place. Think about it this way, throw up is recycled food. If it was good going in, it will be good going out and back in again.

The only time that you need to be concerned is if your dog throws up often within a day. If your dog has thrown up once, wait for about six hours before the next meal. 

If there’s no more vomiting, then you can begin to reintroduce small and bland meals. If the vomiting persists, then it is best you seek medical counsel.

## Conclusion

When your dog throws up and eats it back up, it’s not something to worry about, unless he or she had eaten something poisonous or toxic. It’s as natural as any other habit they have, whether or not we think they are weird.
