## Stages of growth

Like humans as well these dogs come with different stages for their growth. Each of these puppy stages come with its own unique milestones as well as particular care requirements. So if you want to be able to take care of your dog then you should know what you are dealing with and how you are dealing with it.

### Neonatal stage and dependence on mother dog: birth to 2 weeks

### Transitional stage and development of senses and weaning: 2-4 weeks

From two to four weeks, puppies become aware of and interact with their littermates as well as their mother. Their eyes open and their sight is well developed by five weeks.

From four to six weeks, puppies continue to be influenced by their mother and littermates. They learn to play, gaining needed social skills from littermates, such as inhibited biting. The puppies also learn the ins and outs of group structure and ranking within the group. Puppies become much more vocal during this period, with the appearance of play barking and growling.

### Establishing hierarchy within the group: 4-6 months

During this period, puppies grow rapidly and you may notice daily changes. Even though puppies are very energetic, don’t exercise your puppy too much, since he can overdo it.

### Adolescent stage and continued training and socialization: 6-12 months

Like most adolescents, puppies are very rambunctious, so continue the process of training and socializing your dog during this phase. Socialization and training are necessary if you want your puppy to be comfortable and act acceptably in public places such as dog parks and beaches, or anywhere that she will meet new dogs and new people.
