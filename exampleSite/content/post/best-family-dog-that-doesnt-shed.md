Thinking of getting a dog? Perhaps you are looking for a family dog that doesn’t shed. Looking for a new dog is not something you can do by simply ticking boxes, and picking

the one you like from a catalog. This is going to be a new member of your family and you will want to connect with him or her.

However, factors such as shedding of hair are important to consider as well as they can be potential triggers of some respiratory issues. Let's take a look at the different types of nonshedding hypoallergenic dogs that could become the newest member of your family.

Ordered list

* Tibetan terrier
* Maltese terrier
* Shih Tzu
* Brussels griffon
* Portuguese water dog
* Bichon Frise
* Havanese
* Labradoodle
* Lhasa Apso
* Chinese crested

Expanded list

Tibetan terriers may have a lot of hair but they don’t shed it, as what you would expect. Chinese crested dogs already don’t have much hair to talk about so it’s almost a given that it will not shed so much. Shih Tzu dogs are also another household favorite. Besides the fact that they are cute, they are also hypoallergenic.

Brussels Griffon dogs are very friendly and they make great family hypoallergenic dogs as they don’t shed too much hair. Labradoodles, which are a cross between labradors and poodles, shed very little.

Then there are Havanese dogs. These also hardly shed any hair, which is a good thing because of how close they like to stay next to their owners.

The Portuguese water dog looks like a big ball of wool. But the large amount of hair means that you need to groom the dog often, even though it has the advantage of not shedding all over the place.

Bichon Frise dogs are easy dogs to have around your family as they are very independent dogs and also shed very little. The snow-white Maltese terriers are a household favorite and they too do not shed any hair.

Last but not least is the Lhasa Apso breed which is tiny enough to fit in a handbag but has hair that grows out long if it is allowed to. Even though it has those inches, they do not shed.

The above list includes dogs that need grooming and those that do not. If you know that you will not have the time or patience to groom your dog, it is best that you get a breed that requires minimal breeding.

## Conclusion

Whilst you may love the way a particular breed looks, some of them shed a lot and this makes them difficult to have around the home. At the same time, not all dogs are equally

friendly. My favorite breed is the Havanese breed. It's great with children and does not shed a lot, so I know there won’t be too much cleaning up after it to avoid reactions around my home.

Also, I love how friendly it is. I don’t have to worry about it getting along with my guests. We hope this list helps you find the right breed for you and your family.
