Either way, basset hounds health issues can be unique to them, because disease and genetic makeup are closely tied. Let's face it, there's nothing sadder than a sick puppy, so you want to avoid this at all costs.

Let's take a look at what you need to expect in terms of your bassinet hounds health.

## What health issues can I expect my basset hound to face?

Some of the conditions that are common for basset hounds include dental problems, common infections, bone disorders, and obesity. Letâ€™s take a deeper look at what these entail.

### Dental disease

Teeth problems are not uncommon for dogs. Basset hounds are more at risk than other breeds of having teeth problems. It starts with tartar build-up on the teeth it may then start to affect the gums and in time your dog may lose his or her teeth. These problems can lead to bigger problems such as liver and heart problems, and even joint issues and a shortened lifespan.

### Obesity

It may seem cute when your basset hound is chubby and waddles across your living room floor, but obesity can be a big problem with basset hounds, it's better to avoid it than try to fix the issue. Obesity can compound joint issues, back pain, or heart disease. You can avoid this by keeping your pet on a strict diet.

### Infections

Just like all dogs, basset hounds are susceptible to infections from bacteria and viruses. You can avoid your basset hound from getting parvo or rabies or other infections common with dogs, by making sure that you stay on top of his or her vaccinations.

### Eye problems

Basset hounds can inherit eye issues. It is a common genetic issue with basset hounds. Some of these can cause blindness. They can be affected by glaucoma and cataracts just like humans.

### Neurological disease

Basset hounds can also be affected by neurological issues which can cause an unstable gait. This condition is more commonly known as wobbler syndrome. It pinches the dog's spinal cord and also the nerves. This messes up the signal meant to be sent to the dog's legs, which can leave them numb

### Heart disease

Basset hounds are especially at risk of a heart condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy. This is when the heart gets enlarged and too weak such that normal functionality goes out the window.

## Conclusion

Basset hounds have health issues, some of them unique to them alone and others are common to dogs, whilst others are related to daily habits. Most of them can be avoided by making sure that you have a healthy relationship with your vet. Get your dogs shots on time and watch out for potential causes. Your basset hound deserves your love and attention, and just because a certain health issue is common with the breed, does not mean your dog has to suffer from it.
