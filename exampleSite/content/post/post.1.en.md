Number 10 athletic dogs if you lead an active lifestyle and love going for a daily jog you probably wouldn’t mind having a training buddy around would you consider getting a pointer or setter since they’re pretty much built for running if you want something a bit smaller a Jack Russell terrier can be a good choice as well.

## Consider This

It’s not a good idea to get an English bulldog or a puck still most probably struggle from over-exercising steer clear of any large dog breeds too they may be too heavy and the frequent running can damage their joints. Number 9 lap dogs what could be better than chilling out on the couch and watching some TV after a hard day’s work if you’re looking for a furry cuddle buddy will always be happy to lease around on the sofa with you a French bulldog or a Maltese is your perfect fit they’ll always be by your side or in your lap whenever you’re reading a nice book or watching your favorite TV show any working breeds are usually completely different they require lots of exercise and activity hence the name. Number 8 dogs for busy singles a lot of people stop themselves from getting a dog because they’re constantly out of the house.

> Of course, generally speaking dogs are social animals but still some breeds deal with being home alone better than others if this describes your lifestyle think about getting a shar pei or a basset hound retrievers and colleagues on the other hand are too good fit for you because they like and require constant socializing and don’t forget that any dog needs love and attention you should get one if you won’t be able to spend at least some time with your body. Maybe you should get a cat most of the cancer I know could care less if you’re around or not but that’s just me. You haven’t forgotten about the labels have you keep looking.

If you’re retired and have decided to welcome a dog in your home a good option for you would be a Boston terrier a plug for a cavalier King Charles spaniel toy that’s a name their affectionate and playful without requiring lots of exercise large dogs, however, can be a little tricky sometimes they’re most active and need a lot of attention and a sufficient amount of exercise. Number 6 dogs for an apartment now if you’re living in an apartment there are certain dog breeds that will suit you a bit more than others surprisingly the size doesn’t always matter where it’s about the dog’s temperament if the dog is small it doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be happy living in a smaller space consider getting a Yorkshire terrier or a bulldog if you’re interested in chill wallets you might want to think twice here these dogs are tiny but very active.

## What you need to know before getting a dog

Number 5 dogs for multi-pet households if you already have pets at home getting another one is pretty challenging and potentially dangerous you have to choose the breed carefully since you surely want all your pets to get along retrievers colleagues in spaniels are always happy to have the company to play with so they’ll likely make a great match with your other pets terriers are breeds typically used in dawn fighting can sometimes be a bit complicated without a doubt they have beautiful personalities but unfortunately fighter dogs were bred to be aggressive and competitive it’s simply in their nature.

Number 4 dogs they do well in hot climates most of us love summer but not all dogs will agree if you live in a place where it’s hot most of the year you should think carefully about which dog again surprisingly many short hair breeds would seriously struggle in a tropical climate since tolerance to hot weather depends not only on the coat but on the dog’s facial structure in size as well most terriers can’t take the heat and they come in lots of sizes at the same time St Bernards channel 8 and boxers won’t feel good in hot weather.

Number 3 dogs that do well in cold climates if where you live is the complete opposite of the type of climate we just talked about then your options obviously will be different breeds that prefer a colder climate normally have a thick double coat in more body fat so as you can probably guess a good choice is a Saint Bernard malamute husky or Sam or they feel right at home in cold temperatures Dobermans on the other hand 8 the call.

Number 2 hypoallergenic dogs now if you’re allergic to dog hair you’ve probably sworn off the idea of ever owning a canine but hold on there for sec dander which is attached to pad here is the most common cause of pet allergies schnauzers can be a good choice since they’re known for producing less dander than other breeds another good option is a portal and any of its designer crossbreeds like labradoodle spools and the list of GMO doggies goes on just know that your allergies may still act up from time to time but overall it won’t be as bad as with the other Brits German shepherds aren’t a good breed for you due to their dry skin which results in a lot of dander build up the same goes for a long-haired breeze as well or you can always get the dog you want and then just double down on the allergy medicine as I did.

Number one dogs for a newbie getting a dog for the first time ever is both exciting and nerve-wracking there are so many breeds to choose from and they’re all so cute and adorable if you’re new to the dog-owning world then a Labrador border collie or poodle will be perfect for you these breeds are very intelligent relatively easy to train and they’re not stubborn schnauzers and terriers require a bit more patients stop but they’re still great choices the best thing to do is find good shelter in your area make sure to mention you’re a newbie so that they can find you the best fit and next thing you know you’ll be coming home with a lucky dog that’ll surely become your most loyal friend.
