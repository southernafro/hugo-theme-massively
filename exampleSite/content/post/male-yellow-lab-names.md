One of the best things about having a puppy is that you get to name it whatever you want. Choosing a name for a puppy is easy because it’s mostly one of those pet names. You can even name it after a movie you watched and people wouldn’t even mind. Unlike naming a kid you have to give that kid a name with a meaning.

So if you are looking to name your lab, you have found the best place to track down pet names that would be perfect for your male yellow lab. Follow through with this guide and it will help you find a suitable name for your dog.

## Tips on how to name your dog

### Choose a Name That Ends With a Vowel.

Names with vowels change tone when you call for your dog. This matters, because dogs distinguish frequency ranges at a much higher level than we do. With a vowel name, it’s really easy to get their attention.

### Stick With Two Syllables

Avoid those names that make it sound as if you’re talking about a person. Names like Felix or Ellis may not be a good fit for a dog name.

### Avoid Names With Negative Connotations

You might think it’s funny to give your adorable dog the ironic title of Cujo but it’s a bad idea. Not everyone is going to want to pet a dog named Cujo, or dog-sit a dog named Cujo.

### Don’t Pick One That Might Get Confused With Commands

This one is self-explanatory. Imagine if you have a dog named Sit, what will happen when you want to tell your dog to sit down and it thinks you are calling it?

### Dogs Prefer Short Sounds

The sounds within the name you choose will influence your dog as well. Christopher Pachel, a veterinary behaviourist, says that short and choppy gets them to respond quickly, while long, slow, soothing tones do not. An example is that Huck might be preferable to Huckleberry Finn, at least for your dog.
