You must know what you are dealing with. The size of the dog can determine if you can take care of it or not. In this article, we take a look at all you need to know about golden retrievers so you can better prepare to take care of it.

## How Does Spaying or Neutering Affect them

Spaying or neutering does affect labrador retrievers. The first and most obvious effect is that your dog will be unable to reproduce. It can also affect the appearance of the dog depending on what age it was neutered. If a male dog is neutered before it reaches sexual maturity it may not grow into full maturity and look like other male dogs. It may grow up to look like a female labrador in terms of appearance.

The dog's behavior may change to a certain extent. How it changes, is often unexpected and random, you will just have to wait and see. A dog's behavior will not be more subdued because you have had it neutered.

Your labrador retriever is at risk of some cancers if it is neutered. Your dog can also have hip dysplasia and crucial ligament disease if it is neutered or spayed. Studies show that dogs that are spayed are at greater risk of getting cancer than dogs who are not spayed.

But it's not all bad. Spaying has its advantages and so you must stay abreast of all the research concerning spaying your dog. Neutering your female dog helps prevent uterine infections and breast tumors, which turn out to be cancerous in about 50%of dogs that have them. It also discourages your female dog from going into heat. Your male dog will spend less time looking for female dogs. You may begin to see him around the house more because he no longer needs to go out.

Stay away from myths and stick to factual research about spaying your dog. For example, some myths say that spaying your dog will make it gain weight. This is simply untrue and unfounded. If your pet over eats and does not exercise, it is bound to gain weight.

It is important to realize that your dog's mischievous behavior will not dampen down because you have had it neutered. Behavior can be controlled by reigning in bad habits. If they get out of hand you can then seek the help of a behavior specialist. Neutering will not get rid of the bad habits that your dog picks up.

Whilst spaying or neutering has a sizeable amount of research on it, it is ultimately something that you need to take time to carefully consider before you do. Consider the good health and happiness of your dog.

## History of Labrador Retrievers

Labrador retrievers are some of the most common dogs in homes across the world today. One of the reasons for this is because they are versatile multipurpose pets, and have have been this, for the longest time. The breed originated in the 1500s in Newfoundland. Initially, small water dogs were bred by fishermen to jump into the water to retrieve lost fish. These were called St Johns.

They would also pull back nets that had slipped the grip of fishermen. The dogs lived only in Newfoundland until the 1800s where they were then shipped off to England and the breed was further refined to the labradors we love today. The dogs are particularly good at retrieving items in water and as such, they are widely used in hunting and other outdoor activities. They also do well as service dogs and also as guide dogs.

## What is their Personality Like?

Labrador retrievers are an intelligent breed. They have a desire to partner and work with their owner. They are loyal and make great additions to the family. This is why they make great retrieving partners for places where people can not go or are not fast enough to go. Their abilities and personality make them great members of taskforce teams and show dogs.

These dogs have a good nature. Because they are originally meant for water retrieving, you will notice that your labrador probably loves water and fetching different items.

## How to ensure that it grows to full size

To make sure that your labrador is healthy and growing properly, you will have to adhere to feeding charts and your dog's needs. If your dog is above 6 months old then you want to make sure that she or he eats twice a day. The meal portions should be up to 250grams. The older a puppy gets, the more food it will eat but this happens fewer times in a day.

You also want to make sure that you get the best food for your pet. It is not everything that you eat that is right for your dog. This is why it is important to be careful and make sure that your dog is getting a healthy and balanced diet.

If you want to switch your dog's diet, you must do so gradually and carefully. Give your dog's system time to adjust. Even if the food has great reviews and is said to be better than what you have been currently giving your dog, ease it in. You can start by feeding your dog 75% of the old food and 25% of the new diet. Then gradually work your way to the full 100% of the new diet.

If your dog is picky, then find ways to keep him or her interested in the food. However, it is important to make sure that you do not feed the dog too many treats. Also, make sure to regularly check on your dog's health. This means keeping abreast with signs of ill health and also making sure that your dog is getting all that it needs.
