One of the most annoying things about having a pet is having to see some pet hair every time you want to do laundry. You know every time your dog is cuddling with you, you remove some pet hair so why is it, when you are doing laundry you see a whole lot of pet hair.

The simple answer is when you leave your clothes anywhere reachable to your dog. You are bound to see the poodle sleeping on it. So if you are here wondering why your dog sleeps on your clothes, read on to find out the best reasons as to why you may always find pet hair on your favorite jersey. Or some dog drool on your favourite jeans.

## Cause of the behavior

Now for some people, it is not a surprise that their dog simply adores having to sleep on your clothes. When you’re doing laundry the poodle can even come up and sleep on your dirty clothes, but why is the question. Well, I have two possible reasons as to why your dog will do that.

### First reason: Need for soft places to nap

Now if you don’t have a doggy bed for your poodle, this may be a very common problem for you. Dogs love soft places to rest and cuddle on. No wonder it’s always by your couch or even your bed. Dogs like comfort just as much as we humans do.

So when you pile up your clothes on the floor and you leave them while you go get your washing soap, when your passes by and sees a whole lump of soft clothes, why wouldn’t it want to get a feel of the clothes. It may spread those clothes to get some of the best comfort ever imaginable. Probably in its head it will be thinking that you were trying to create a soft bed for it.

### Second reason: Your scent

A dog’s sense of scent is one of it’s strongest abilities. That’s why you see that dogs are always sniffing things. Now when it comes to you, your dog has a very strong attachment to you. You are literally the one person it thinks of every day and night. You are always on its mind. That’s why they say a dog’s love is the greatest kind of love.

Now imagine a dog smelling a whole puddle of you? Would you blame it, if it went to cuddle up on your clothes. It’s annoying but probably one of the cutest things I have ever had to know. It will be all laid up in your clothes, hoping to feel closer to you. So if you and your dog are good buddies, best believe this will not stop anytime soon unless you hide your clothes.

## Final Thoughts

When you think of it, dogs are actually cute, even if they do the most annoying and irritating things possible. It’s all out of sheer love and butterflies for you. So unless you decide to hide your clothes. This problem is less likely to disappear
